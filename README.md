# Bestivals
## A compendium of the greatest festivals around.
### Made by Carrie Sampson, GG Gonzalez, &amp; Princeton Evans.



### Overview
  This a library of great festivals around the United States of America. Anyone can make their own account and add their favorite festivals, or update the info an an existing one. Each post contains a photo of the festival, the name of the festival, its location, date, ticket price, and type of festival. You can click on the larger photos at the top of the homepage to filter festivals by type, and can click on individual festivals in the list to show its details below.

### Deployment
  Heroku is a cloud platform as a service that I used as my web application deployment model. To view live, visit https://bestivalsapp.herokuapp.com/.


### Approach
  We used all 7 RESTful routes and CRUD. The dependencies we used included Bcrypt, EJS, Express, Express-session, JSON, Mongoose, Morgan, and Pretty-Error.

### Technical Difficulties
  We had a handful of technical and inter-personal communication difficulties while building this app. We also had some pretty nasty merge conflicts, including a 250-line conflict. This was a valuable lesson in coding in a group.

### Future Implementations
  In the future, we would like to add comment functionality with full CRUD, have the user only be able to edit/delete festivals and comments that they posted, make a profile for each user with everything they've posted, tag/link festival locations on Google maps, make hover animations, add search tags functionality/more robust filtering (on-click), add "likes" functionality, and increase the responsiveness of the page.

### Tech Used
  -HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, NPM, with the full MEAN Stack of MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js.
  -Atom for text-editing.
  -Postman for testing.

#### Credits
  Most of the photos we used are from google, but this application is just for educational purposes.

#### Acknowledgments
  Thank you to all our classmates and TAs who helped us get through this project and create a functioning web application. Special thanks to Foryst, Tyler, Hector, and Madison for helping us through some key issues, and Karolin for helping us get through our conflicts, both mmerge-based and inter-personal.
