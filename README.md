# Bestivals
## A compendium of the greatest festivals around.
### Made by Carrie Sampson, GG Gonzalez, &amp; Princeton Evans.



### Overview
  This a library of great festivals around the United States of America. Anyone can make their own account and add their favorite festivals, or update the info an an existing one. Each post contains a photo of the festival, the name of the festival, its location, date, ticket price, and type of festival. You can click on the larger photos at the top of the homepage to filter festivals by type, and can click on individual festivals in the list to show its details below.

## Deployment
  Heroku is a cloud platform as a service that I used as my web application deployment model. To view live, visit https://bestivalsapp.herokuapp.com/.


### Approach
  We used all 7 RESTful routes and CRUD. The dependencies we used included Bcrypt, EJS, Express, Express-session, JSON, Mongoose, Morgan, and Pretty-Error.

### Technical Difficulties
  We had a handful of technical and inter-personal communication difficulties while building this app.

### Future Implementations
  In the future, we would like to add a comment model, have the user only be able to edit/delete posts and comments that they posted, tag/link to locations of festivals on Google maps, make hover animations, be able to add photos by upload, add search functionality and tags, and improve my css and sense of color.

### Tech Used
  -HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Express, Node.js, NPM MongoDB, AngularJS.
  -Atom for text-editing.

### Credits
  Most of the photos we used are from google, but this application is just for educational purposes.

### Acknowledgments
  Thank you to all our classmates and TAs who helped me get through this project and create a functioning web application. Special thanks to Tyler and Foryst for helping us through some key issues.
